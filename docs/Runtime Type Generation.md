 Here are key reasons to avoid build-time schema generation:

  ðŸš« Reasons to Avoid Build-Time Schema Generation

  1. Runtime Environment Dependencies

  # Build fails if GraphQL server is down
  ERROR: Failed to introspect schema from http://localhost:4000/graphql
  Connection refused - build cannot continue
  - CI/CD Pipeline Issues: Builds fail when GraphQL service is unavailable
  - Local Development: New developers can't build without running all services
  - Docker Builds: Complex service orchestration required during build

  2. Microservices & Dynamic Schemas

  // Schema varies by environment/tenant
  const endpoint = getTenantSpecificEndpoint(tenantId);
  // Build-time codegen can't handle this variability
  - Multi-tenant Applications: Different schemas per tenant
  - Feature Flags: Schema fields enabled/disabled at runtime
  - A/B Testing: Different schema versions for different user groups

  3. Development Workflow Friction

  # Every schema change requires rebuild
  1. Update GraphQL schema
  2. Regenerate types: npm run codegen
  3. Fix TypeScript errors
  4. Commit generated files
  5. Deal with merge conflicts in generated code
  - Slow Iteration: Schema changes require full rebuild cycle
  - Merge Conflicts: Generated files create Git conflicts
  - Developer Onboarding: Complex setup process

  4. Third-Party API Integration

  // External APIs you don't control
  const externalAPIs = [
    'https://api.github.com/graphql',
    'https://api.shopify.com/graphql',
    'https://hasura-cloud-project.hasura.app/v1/graphql'
  ];
  // Build-time generation becomes impractical
  - External Services: Can't guarantee availability during build
  - API Versioning: External APIs change independently
  - Rate Limiting: Introspection queries count against limits

  5. Edge Computing & Serverless

  // Edge function that needs to be lightweight
  export default async function handler(request) {
    // Can't include large generated type files
    // Need minimal bundle size
  }
  - Cold Start Performance: Large generated files increase startup time
  - Bundle Size Limits: Generated types can be massive
  - Memory Constraints: Edge environments have strict limits

  6. Schema Evolution Challenges

  {
    "error": "Field 'user.avatar' no longer exists",
    "generatedAt": "2024-01-15",
    "schemaChangedAt": "2024-01-20"
  }
  - Breaking Changes: Generated types become stale
  - Gradual Migration: Hard to support multiple schema versions
  - Backward Compatibility: Generated types lock you into specific versions

  7. Monorepo Complexity

  # Multiple services with different schemas
  apps/
    admin-app/        # Uses admin schema
    customer-app/     # Uses public schema  
    mobile-app/       # Uses mobile schema
  # Each needs different generated types
  - Schema Coordination: Multiple services need different types
  - Build Ordering: Dependencies between type generation steps
  - Shared Types: Conflicts when sharing generated code

  8. Testing & Mocking Difficulties

  // Hard to mock generated types
  const mockUser: GeneratedUserType = {
    // Must match exact generated interface
    id: "1",
    name: "Test",
    email: "test@example.com",
    // 50+ other required fields from generated type
  };
  - Test Setup Complexity: Generated types have many required fields
  - Mock Maintenance: Tests break when schema changes
  - Snapshot Testing: Generated types create noise in snapshots

  9. Library & Package Distribution

  {
    "name": "@company/graphql-client",
    "main": "dist/index.js",
    "dependencies": {
      "generated-types": "file:./generated"
    }
  }
  - Package Publishing: Can't include generated types in published packages
  - Version Management: Generated types tied to specific schema versions
  - Consumer Flexibility: Library users locked into your schema assumptions

  10. Security & Compliance

  // Generated types might expose sensitive schema details
  interface GeneratedAdminUser {
    id: string;
    email: string;
    internalNotes: string;  // Oops - leaked internal field
    salaryInfo: number;     // Shouldn't be in client types
  }
  - Information Leakage: Generated types might expose internal fields
  - Audit Trails: Hard to track what schema information is embedded
  - Data Privacy: Generated types become part of client bundle

  âœ… Runtime-Only Alternatives

  Flexible Query Builder

  // No schema dependency, full type safety
  const query = QueryBuilder
    .select('id', 'name', 'email')
    .from('users')
    .where('active', true);

  Runtime Validation

  // Validate responses at runtime
  const UserSchema = z.object({
    id: z.string(),
    name: z.string(),
    email: z.string().email()
  });

  Gradual Typing

  // Start loose, tighten over time
  interface User {
    id: string;
    [key: string]: any; // Allow unknown fields
  }

  The key insight: Build-time generation trades flexibility for type safety, but modern
  TypeScript patterns can provide both without the complexity.
